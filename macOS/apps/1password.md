# [1Password](https://1password.com)

Generate all of my passwords with it and keep everything in a secured and encrypted vault kept secure by my one master password.

No longer need to remember passwords and I now have a unique password for every website that I am signed up on whilst [activating two factor authentication](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/) wherever possible.
